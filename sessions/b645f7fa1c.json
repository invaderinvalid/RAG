      "question": "What is CNN",
      "answer": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network widely used for image recognition, classification, and other image-related tasks [arxiv:2203.10596]. It is a deep learning model that processes images by mimicking how the human visual cortex processes visual information [arxiv:2203.10596].\n\nHere's a detailed chain-of-thought analysis of what a CNN is, based on the provided context:\n\n1.  **Core Concept: Mimicking Human Vision**\n    *   The fundamental idea behind CNNs is to replicate how the visual cortex processes images [arxiv:2203.10596]. Neurons in the visual cortex process images by breaking them down into increasingly complex shapes [arxiv:2203.10596].\n    *   CNNs achieve this by using multiple layers of artificial neurons to mimic this hierarchical processing [arxiv:2203.10596].\n\n2.  **Architecture and Processing:**\n    *   A standard CNN architecture includes several **convolutional layers** [arxiv:2203.10596]. These layers are crucial as they segment the input image into smaller pieces that can be easily processed [arxiv:2203.10596].\n    *   The processing within these layers is hierarchical:\n        *   Initially, the image is segmented at the boundaries of edges using light/dark interfaces [arxiv:2203.10596].\n        *   These initial segments are then fused into simple shapes [arxiv:2203.10596].\n        *   Finally, in subsequent layers, these simple shapes are fused into recognizable complex features [arxiv:2203.10596].\n    *   The outputs from these convolutional layers are aggregated in subsequent layers [arxiv:2203.10596].\n    *   Many convolutional layers, except possibly the last, typically use **ReLU activation functions** [arxiv:1903.06254].\n\n3.  **Learning and Feature Extraction:**\n    *   Unlike earlier approaches that relied on handcrafted features, CNN-based models are trained to automatically identify relevant biomarkers or features from a large dataset without explicit input from researchers [arxiv:2203.10596]. This means the network learns *what* features are important directly from the data.\n\n4.  **Key Characteristics and Advantages:**\n    *   **Robustness and Generalization:** CNNs can be designed to be robust, meaning they perform well even with noisy data. They also demonstrate an ability for generalization, predicting accurate results even for unknown geometries not seen during training [arxiv:1903.06254]. This is often achieved by adding a mix of noisy simulated and real data during training [arxiv:1903.06254].\n    *   **Performance:** CNNs can achieve high performance, such as real-time optical flow detection (up to 140 frames per second), outperforming state-of-the-art methods [arxiv:1903.06254].\n    *   **Handling Complex Tasks:** They are capable of estimating complex multidirectional flows and even perform well for rotational flows, which traditionally require computationally intensive methods [arxiv:1903.06254].\n\n5.  **Applications Mentioned in Context:**\n    *   **Vector Flow Imaging (VFI) / Velocity Estimation:** CNNs can be used for velocity estimation in ultrasound images, particularly for estimating complex multidirectional blood flow [arxiv:1903.06254]. An example is a CNN based on the FlowNetSimple architecture used for this purpose [arxiv:1903.06254].\n    *   **Optical Flow Estimation:** CNNs, such as variants of FlowNet, have been successfully applied to estimate optical flow [arxiv:1903.06254].\n    *   **Image Recognition and Classification:** They are widely used for general image recognition and classification tasks, including identifying relevant biomarkers [arxiv:2203.10596]. A CNN-based binary classifier method can be used to predict whether new examples belong to a positive or negative class [arxiv:2203.10596].\n\n6.  **Important Consideration:**\n    *   A CNN's specialization and performance are defined by its training data distribution [arxiv:2203.10596]. This means it's crucial that the data it processes is similar to the data it was trained on; otherwise, it might not provide reliable predictions [arxiv:2203.10596].",

      "question": "What is CNN",
      "answer": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of artificial neural network (ANN) that has proven exceptionally effective for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images. It is a deep learning model designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data, mimicking how the human visual cortex processes visual information.\n\n### Key Concepts and How CNNs Work\n\nCNNs are built upon a series of layers, each performing a specific transformation on its input. The primary layers include:\n\n1.  **Convolutional Layer:**\n    *   **Filters (Kernels):** This is the core building block. A small matrix of numbers, called a filter or kernel, slides across the input image (or feature map from a previous layer).\n    *   **Convolution Operation:** At each position, the filter performs an element-wise multiplication with the corresponding patch of the image and sums the results, producing a single output value. This operation is called convolution.\n    *   **Feature Maps:** As the filter slides across the entire image, it creates a 2D activation map (or feature map) that indicates the presence of the learned feature (e.g., edges, textures, corners) in different locations of the input.\n    *   **Parameter Sharing:** A crucial aspect is that the same filter is applied across the entire image. This significantly reduces the number of parameters the network needs to learn, making it more efficient and robust to translation (i.e., if a feature moves slightly in the image, the same filter can still detect it).\n    *   **Multiple Filters:** A convolutional layer typically uses multiple filters, each learning to detect a different feature, resulting in a stack of feature maps.\n\n2.  **Activation Function (e.g., ReLU):**\n    *   After the convolution operation, an activation function (commonly the Rectified Linear Unit, ReLU: $f(x) = \\max(0, x)$) is applied element-wise to the feature maps. This introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns.\n\n3.  **Pooling Layer (Downsampling):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps, thereby reducing the number of parameters and computational cost. This also helps to control overfitting and makes the network more robust to small variations or distortions in the input (translation invariance).\n    *   **Types:**\n        *   **Max Pooling:** The most common type, it takes the maximum value from a small window (e.g., 2x2) in the feature map.\n        *   **Average Pooling:** Takes the average value from the window.\n    *   **Output:** A smaller, summarized feature map.\n\n4.  **Fully Connected Layer (Dense Layer):**\n    *   **Flattening:** After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level features learned by the network are \"flattened\" into a single long vector.\n    *   **Classification:** This vector is then fed into one or more fully connected layers, similar to a traditional neural network. Each neuron in a fully connected layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.\n    *   **Output Layer:** The final fully connected layer typically has an output activation function (e.g., softmax for multi-class classification) that produces the final class probabilities.\n\n### Advantages of CNNs\n\n*   **Automatic Feature Learning:** Unlike traditional image processing methods that require manual feature engineering, CNNs automatically learn relevant features directly from the raw pixel data.\n*   **Parameter Sharing:** Reduces the number of trainable parameters, making the network more efficient and less prone to overfitting.\n*   **Sparsity of Connections:** Each neuron in a convolutional layer is only connected to a small region of the input (its receptive field), rather than the entire input.\n*   **Translation Invariance:** The ability to recognize a feature regardless of its position in the image, due to parameter sharing and pooling.\n*   **Hierarchical Feature Extraction:** Early layers learn low-level features (edges, corners), while deeper layers combine these to learn more complex, high-level features (parts of objects, entire objects).\n\n### Seminal Papers and Architectures\n\nThe field of CNNs has seen rapid advancements, driven by several groundbreaking architectures:\n\n*   **LeNet-5 (1998) by Yann LeCun et al.:** One of the earliest successful CNNs, used for handwritten digit recognition (e.g., ZIP codes). It introduced the fundamental concepts of convolutional and pooling layers.\n    *   *Resource:* LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.\n*   **AlexNet (2012) by Alex Krizhevsky et al.:** Revolutionized computer vision by winning the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) by a significant margin. It demonstrated the power of deep CNNs with ReLU activation and GPU acceleration.\n    *   *Resource:* Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 25.\n*   **VGG (2014) by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman:** Explored the effect of network depth on accuracy, showing that deeper networks with very small (3x3) convolutional filters could achieve excellent performance.\n*   **ResNet (2015) by Kaiming He et al.:** Introduced \"residual connections\" (skip connections) that allowed for training extremely deep networks (hundreds of layers) by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.\n*   **Inception (GoogLeNet) (2014) by Christian Szegedy et al.:** Introduced the \"Inception module,\" which allows the network to learn multiple feature representations at different scales within the same layer, leading to more efficient use of computational resources.\n\n### Applications\n\nCNNs are the backbone of many state-of-the-art applications in computer vision and beyond:\n\n*   **Image Classification:** Identifying the main object or scene in an image (e.g., cat, dog, landscape).\n*   **Object Detection:** Locating and classifying multiple objects within an image (e.g., self-driving cars detecting pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic signs).\n*   **Image Segmentation:** Assigning a class label to every pixel in an image (e.g., separating foreground from background, identifying specific organs in medical images).\n*   **Facial Recognition:** Identifying individuals from images or videos.\n*   **Medical Imaging:** Diagnosing diseases from X-rays, MRIs, CT scans.\n*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** While primarily for images, CNNs have also been adapted for text analysis tasks, especially for feature extraction from sequences.\n\nIn summary, CNNs are powerful deep learning models that have transformed the field of computer vision by providing an effective and efficient way to learn hierarchical features directly from raw image data, leading to unprecedented performance in a wide range of visual tasks.",

The paper [arxiv:2006.03349] discusses improvements upon a \"standalone NCNN\" [arxiv:2006.03349].\n\nHere's a detailed chain-of-thought analysis of NCNN:\n\n1.  **Core Functionality and Application:**\n    *   NCNN is a neural network used for processing input data, often in tasks such as depth estimation on datasets like NYU and KITTI-Depth, or sparse optical flow rectification [arxiv:2006.03349].\n    *   It is designed to handle sparse input data [arxiv:2006.03349].\n\n2.  **Input Confidence Handling:**\n    *   The standard NCNN assigns \"binary confidence\" to its input [arxiv:2006.03349]. This means it treats all input measurements as either fully reliable or completely unreliable.\n    *   In a broader pipeline, NCNN can receive input data along with an estimated input confidence from a preceding network [arxiv:2006.03349].\n\n3.  **Architecture (Implicit):**\n    *   NCNN is described as having multiple layers, with an \"output confidence from the last NCNN layer\" [arxiv:2006.03349]. This output confidence can then be used by subsequent components, such as a UNet for noise parameter estimation [arxiv:2006.03349].\n\n4.  **Limitations of Standard NCNN:**\n    *   **Edge Artifacts:** Due to its binary input confidence assignment, NCNN \"struggles along edges\" and produces \"artifacts at regions with disturbed measurements especially edges\" [arxiv:2006.03349]. This occurs because it \"equally trust[s] the background and the foreground\" [arxiv:2006.03349].\n    *   **Lack of Proper Uncertainty Measures:** The output confidences generated by a standard NCNN do not \"exhibit a proper uncertainty measure that is strongly correlated with the error\" [arxiv:2006.03349].

      "answer": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of artificial neural network (ANN) that has proven exceptionally effective for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images, videos, and even certain types of sequential data. It is a deep learning model designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data, mimicking how the human visual cortex processes visual information.\n\nCNNs are particularly powerful because they can learn to identify patterns and features at various levels of abstraction directly from raw pixel data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.\n\n### Key Concepts and How CNNs Work\n\nCNNs are built upon a series of specialized layers, each performing a specific transformation on the input data. The typical architecture of a CNN involves an alternating sequence of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers at the end.\n\n1.  **Convolutional Layer:**\n    *   **Core Idea:** This is the foundational building block of a CNN. Instead of connecting every neuron to every pixel in the input (as in a traditional ANN), a convolutional layer uses small filters (also called kernels) that slide across the input image.\n    *   **Filters/Kernels:** These are small matrices of learnable weights. Each filter is designed to detect a specific feature, such as edges, textures, or specific patterns.\n    *   **Convolution Operation:** The filter performs a dot product with the small region of the input it's currently covering. This operation is repeated across the entire input image, generating a **feature map** (or activation map) that indicates where the detected feature is present in the input.\n    *   **Local Receptive Fields:** Each neuron in a convolutional layer is only connected to a small, localized region of the input, mimicking the way neurons in the visual cortex respond to specific regions of the visual field.\n    *   **Parameter Sharing:** The same filter (set of weights) is applied across the entire input image. This significantly reduces the number of parameters the network needs to learn, making the model more efficient and robust to translation (i.e., if a feature moves to a different part of the image, the same filter can still detect it).\n\n2.  **Activation Function (e.g., ReLU):**\n    *   After each convolution operation, an activation function (commonly Rectified Linear Unit, ReLU) is applied element-wise to the feature map. This introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns than it could with linear transformations alone.\n\n3.  **Pooling Layer (or Downsampling Layer):**\n    *   **Purpose:** These layers reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps, thereby reducing the computational cost and the number of parameters, and helping to control overfitting.\n    *   **Operation:** A pooling layer slides a window (e.g., 2x2) over the feature map and applies an aggregation function.\n    *   **Types:**\n        *   **Max Pooling:** Selects the maximum value within the window. This is the most common type, as it helps to preserve the most prominent features.\n        *   **Average Pooling:** Calculates the average value within the window.\n    *   **Benefits:** It makes the network more robust to small translations or distortions in the input image (translation invariance).\n\n4.  **Fully Connected (FC) Layer:**\n    *   **Purpose:** After several convolutional and pooling layers have extracted high-level features, the feature maps are flattened into a single vector. This vector is then fed into one or more fully connected layers, similar to a traditional ANN.\n    *   **Function:** These layers perform high-level reasoning and classification based on the features learned by the preceding layers.\n    *   **Output Layer:** The final FC layer typically has an activation function (e.g., softmax for multi-class classification) that produces the final prediction probabilities.\n\n### Advantages of CNNs\n\n*   **Automatic Feature Learning:** CNNs can automatically learn relevant features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.\n*   **Parameter Sharing:** Reduces the number of learnable parameters, making the model more efficient and less prone to overfitting.\n*   **Sparse Connectivity (Local Receptive Fields):** Each neuron only processes a small part of the input, which is computationally efficient and biologically inspired.\n*   **Translation Invariance:** Due to parameter sharing and pooling, CNNs can recognize patterns regardless of their position in the input image.\n*   **Hierarchical Feature Extraction:** Early layers learn low-level features (edges, corners), while deeper layers combine these into more complex, high-level features (objects, parts of objects).\n\n### Applications\n\nCNNs are the backbone of many state-of-the-art systems in various domains:\n\n*   **Image Classification:** Identifying the main object in an image (e.g., cat, dog, car).\n*   **Object Detection:** Locating and classifying multiple objects within an image (e.g., self-driving cars detecting pedestrians, other vehicles).\n*   **Image Segmentation:** Assigning a class label to every pixel in an image (e.g., medical image analysis, autonomous driving).\n*   **Facial Recognition:** Identifying individuals from images or videos.\n*   **Medical Imaging:** Detecting diseases from X-rays, MRIs, CT scans.\n*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** While primarily designed for images, CNNs can also be used for text classification and sentiment analysis by treating text as a 1D sequence.\n\n### Seminal Papers and Architectures\n\nThe development of CNNs has been marked by several influential architectures:\n\n*   **LeNet-5 (1998) by Yann LeCun et al.:** One of the earliest successful CNNs, used for handwritten digit recognition.

These papers demonstrate a focus on enhancing VLMs for 3D spatial understanding, temporal reasoning, and object detection tasks.\n\n1.  **VLM-3R: Enhancing VLMs with 3D Reconstructive Instruction Tuning**\n    A novel framework called VLM-3R significantly enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through reconstructive instruction tuning [arxiv:2505.20279]. VLM-3R is a unified framework designed to process monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D tokens, which represent spatial understanding [arxiv:2505.20279]. It leverages Spatial-Visual\u2013View Fusion and over 200,000 curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning question-answer (QA) pairs to align real-world spatial context with language instructions [arxiv:2505.20279]. This enables capabilities such as monocular 3D spatial assistance and embodied reasoning [arxiv:2505.20279].\n\n    The VLM-3R framework also introduces the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence (VSI-Bench) benchmark, which features over 138,600 QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving spatial relationships, to facilitate the evaluation of temporal reasoning [arxiv:2505.20279]. Ablation studies on VLM-3R components, specifically Geometry Tokens and Camera Tokens, demonstrate their impact on performance [arxiv:2505.20279]. Removing geometry tokens leads to a notable performance degradation, particularly in tasks requiring an understanding of scene structure and object properties, such as Relative Distance and Route Planning [arxiv:2505.20279]. Similarly, the absence of camera tokens also results in a performance decrease [arxiv:2505.20279].\n\n2.  **Rapid Growth in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Object Detection**\n    There has been a rapid growth in publications utilizing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for object detection [arxiv:2508.19294]. As of April 20, 2025, research in this area is expanding, focusing on \"multimodal LVLMs,\" \"prompted object localization,\" and \"image-text grounding\" [arxiv:2508.19294]. These studies emphasize models that integrate pretrained or fine-tuned vision-language architectures specifically applied to object detection tasks [arxiv:2508.19294]. The evaluation criteria for these contributions highlight architectural transparency, methodological rigor, and their relevance to either foundational development or real-world deployment [arxiv:2508.19294].\n\n### Summary of Latest VLM Research\n\nRecent papers on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a strong focus on enhancing their capabilities for complex spatial and temporal reasoning, particularly within 3D environments and video contexts.\n\nOne significant development is **VLM-3R**, a novel framework that improves VLMs through 3D reconstructive instruction tuning [arxiv:2505.20279]. This framework processes monocular video frames by using a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D tokens, thereby gaining spatial understanding [arxiv:2505.20279]. By leveraging Spatial-Visual\u2013View Fusion and a large dataset of 3D reconstructive instruction tuning question-answer pairs, VLM-3R aligns real-world spatial context with language instructions, enabling monocular 3D spatial assistance and embodied reasoning [arxiv:2505.20279]. The effectiveness of specific components like Geometry Tokens and Camera Tokens in VLM-3R has been demonstrated, showing their crucial role in tasks requiring scene structure and object property understanding [arxiv:2505.20279]. This work also introduces the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence (VSI-Bench) benchmark to evaluate temporal reasoning [arxiv:2505.20279].\n\nConcurrently, there is a notable and rapid increase in publications focusing on **Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for object detection** [arxiv:2508.19294]. This area explores \"multimodal LVLMs,\" \"prompted object localization,\" and \"image-text grounding,\" with models incorporating pretrained or fine-tuned vision-language architectures for object detection tasks [arxiv:2508.19294]. The emphasis in these studies is on robust methodologies and practical applicability [arxiv:2508.19294].\n\nThese recent works indicate a trend towards more sophisticated VLMs capable of deeper spatial-temporal understanding and more precise object interaction in real-world scenarios.\n\n## References\n\n*   [arxiv:2505.20279] VLM-3R: Vision-Language Models with 3D Reconstructive Instruction Tuning.

      "question": "[paper:2412.06439] what are the methodologies used in it ?",
      "answer": "The paper \"arxiv:2412.06439\" describes several methodologies, primarily focusing on enhancing upsampling in optical flow models, particularly through the introduction of a Transformed-based convex upsampling approach (TCU) and specific training strategies.\n\n### Chain-of-Thought Analysis:\n\n1.  **Core Problem Addressed:** The paper addresses the challenge of upsampling in optical flow models, noting that current state-of-the-art models require an upsampling factor of 8, which makes traditional methods unsuitable [arxiv:2412.06439]. Convex upsampling is widely adopted by these models [arxiv:2412.06439].\n\n2.  **Proposed Upsampling Methodology: Transformed-based Convex Upsampling (TCU)**\n    *   **Decoupled Upsampler:** The core idea is to \"decouple the convex upsampler of the last refinement iteration and give it its own weights\" [arxiv:2412.06439]. This allows the final output refinement iteration to focus solely on its objective without sharing parameters with earlier, potentially noisy, estimates [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Integration of TCU:** The \"original shared convex upsampler is used for the first (I\u22121) refinement iterations, and TCU is only used for the last refinement iteration which provides the final model output\" [arxiv:2412.06439]. At test-time, only the upsampler of the last refinement iteration (TCU) is used [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Formulating Convex Upsampling as Local Self-Attention:** The paper extends the reasoning behind convex upsampling by formulating it as local self-attention [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Attention Mechanisms:**\n        *   **Multi-head Attention:** For an upsampling factor 'f', multi-head attention is employed to generate 'f^2' attention maps for each low-resolution pixel [arxiv:2412.06439]. The head dimensionality is set to 1/2D, halving the embedding dimensionality for each upsampling operation [arxiv:2412.06439].\n        *   **Neighborhood Attention Transformer Blocks:** These blocks are utilized to perform local neighborhood attention, which serves to enhance features [arxiv:2412.06439]. Attention is applied to both upsample the low-resolution flow and the feature maps [arxiv:2412.06439].\n\n3.  **Training Methodologies:**\n    *   **Decoupled Upsampler Training:** The weights of the convex upsampler for the last refinement iteration (TCU) are randomly initialized, while the flow predictor and the convex upsampler for the first (I\u22121) iterations start with pre-trained weights [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Learning Rates:** A learning rate of 1e-4 is used for the pre-trained weights, and a higher learning rate of 2e-4 is used for the untrained upsampler of the last refinement iteration [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Fine-tuning:** Experiments involve fine-tuning for 100K iterations with a batch size of 3 on the dataset the model was last trained on [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Warm Start Strategy:** A warm start strategy, as described by RAFT [30], is employed [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Data Augmentation Investigation:** The paper investigates the effect of sampling in data augmentation, noting that many recent works use bilinear sampling for training data augmentation, even though convex upsampling was originally intended to avoid bilinear upsampling on flow maps [arxiv:2412.06439]. An additional training scheme is explored to remove bilinear interpolation artifacts [arxiv:2412.06439].\n\n4.  **Evaluation Methodologies:**\n    *   **Performance on High-Detail Areas:** A specific focus is placed on evaluating performance in high-detail regions [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Patch-based Analysis:** This is investigated by examining performance on non-overlapping 32x32 patches of the test data [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Edge Detection for Detail Assessment:** The L2 norm of spatial gradients, extracted using the Kornia library [23], is used as an edge detector to correlate with the amount of detail and difficulty for the upsampler [arxiv:2412.06439]. A binary threshold of 8 is applied to obtain a binary edge map [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Tile Technique:** The tile technique, as described by FlowFormer [9], is used for evaluation [arxiv:2412.06439].\n\n5.  **Baseline and Related Upsampling Approaches:**\n    *   **Non-learning based:** Nearest Neighbor, bilinear, or bicubic interpolation [6, 29] [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Learning-based:** Transposed convolutions [18], PixelShuffle [24], or convex upsampling [30] [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **SOTA Optical Flow Models:** Current state-of-the-art optical flow models [9, 14, 25, 26, 30, 33, 36, 38] widely adopt convex upsampling due to the required upsampling factor of 8 [arxiv:2412.06439].\n    *   **Multi-step Upsampling Inspiration:** The paper is inspired by MS-RAFT(+) [12, 13], which upsamples 3 times by a factor of 2, rather than once by a factor of 8, and investigates the impact of this 3-step approach [arxiv:2412.06439].\n\n## References\n*   [arxiv:2412.06439] \"Transformed-based convex upsampling for optical flow\" (2024).",
